### Objective

Build out this NFT card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) can be summed up with one word: "unique". These are smart contracts deployed on a blockchain that represent something unique. For example, the Mona Lisa is non-fungible. Although someone can make a copy of it, there will never be two Mona Lisas. If the Mona Lisa was created on a blockchain, it would be an NFT.

### Tasks

Using JavaScript and React, your task is to build out this responsive NFT card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for interactive elements

You will find a version of the design both for mobile and for desktop. All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun!** ðŸš€
